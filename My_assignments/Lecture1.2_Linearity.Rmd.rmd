### Definition

A linear function $f(x)$ is one with the property

$$
f(ax_1 + bx_2) = af(x_1) + bf(x_2)
$$

### Problems

1. Prove that $f(x) = \beta x$ is linear.


$$
f(x) = \beta x 
$$
$$
f(ax_1 + bx_2) = \beta(ax_1 + bx_2)        
$$
$$
= a \beta x_1 + b \beta x_2 
$$
$$
= \beta a x_1 + \beta b x_2  
$$
$$               
= a f(x_a) + b f(x_2)        
$$

$$ 
f(ax_1 + bx_2) = af(x_1) + bf(x_2)
$$


$$
qed.
$$



2. Prove that $f(x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 x^2$ is *not* linear. 

$$
f(x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 x^2
$$
$$
f'(x) = \beta_1 x + \beta_2 *2x_2
$$

$$
f''(x) = \beta_2 * 2
$$

This result does not show linearity. However, as a model is linear if the beta coefficients are linear, we will look at the coefficients instead of the predictors:
$$
f(\beta) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta x_2^2
$$

$$
f'(\beta) = 1 + x_1 + x_2^2
$$

$$
f''(\beta) = 0
$$

$$
qed.
$$

The model $f(x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 x^2$ is linear.
